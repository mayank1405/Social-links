## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page



### Links


- Live Site URL:https://mayank1405.github.io/Social-links/

## My process
Process was simple. Made a grey box, then made two divs, one for image and text, another for the hover buttons/tabs. Applied relevant html,css properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### Continued development

Will improve upon this making it much more dynamic and incorporate actual links to the various accounts.
